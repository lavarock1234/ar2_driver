ROS compatible driver for AR2 robot https://www.anninrobotics.com/

[ROS](http://www.ros.org) and [MoveIt!](http://moveit.ros.org) are very powerful tools for industrial manipulators. They are used widely in many industries to control industrial manipulators. Some manipulators are available on [ROS-Industrial project](https://rosindustrial.org).  However, currently ROS only works on Unix/Linux like systems.  This driver allow one to use AR2 robot in conjunction with ROS on linux.
